# Setting up Janssen development environment
## Overview

This is a generic guide for setting up a development environment that enables compilation and testing of Janssen components. For a complete development environment, you need two things: 
1) Janssen server for development
2) Workspace which has code and tests that you can run 
In this guide, we will see how to setup both on the same machine.

## Prerequisites

### Minimal hardware requirements

- 8 GB RAM for Janssen server installation
- 4 GB RAM free to run test cases and builds
- CPU with at least two cores
- 40 GB harddisk space

### Minimal software requirements

Janssen installation : During setup installer can prompt to install missing package. 

Build and test code  : Most basic tools required are
- `git`  : To clone and manage the inav code repository
- `java` : Java to run maven and build. Needs Java 1.8 or above
- `mvn`  : latest maven
- Other tools like IDE etc can be of your choice

## Installing Janssen server:

When you plan to develop and contribute code to Janssen, you need a running Janssen server in order to run your tests and verify that your feature or bug fix is working as intended. You can plan to install Janssen server on local Windows machine, Linux machine or you may planning to install Janssen using Janssen cloud based deployment. 

Janssen auth server installs on Linux based operating system, primarily, Ubuntu. If your development environment is using a different operating system, like Windows, we have to leverage virtualization tools to install Janssen server. Follow the instructions listed in sections below as appropriate.

1) On Windows OS
    `TODO`
2) On Ubuntu 20.4
    `TODO`
3) [On remote server](https://github.com/ossdhaval/home/blob/main/development.md#installing-janssen-auth-server-on-remote-server) ( like a Google Cloud Platform or AWS Linux instance )
4) On Cloud based deployment

### Installing Janssen auth server on Windows machine

Janssen runs on Linux based operating system Ubuntu. In order to run it on a Windows machine, we have to leverage virtualization technique as described in steps below.

#### Prepare your Windows machine

Steps:

    1) `TODO`
    2) `TODO`

Once you have executed above steps, your GCP instance is ready for [Janssen installation](https://github.com/ossdhaval/home/blob/main/development.md#install-janssen).

### Installing Janssen auth server on remote server

If you have limited hardware resources on your local machine, then you may install Janssen on a remote server. For this you need to have access to a remote server, either standalone or an instance hosted on any cloud platform like GCP or AWS. Here in this guide, we will take example of installing Janssen server on an GCP instance.

#### Prepare GCP instance

Steps:

    1) `TODO`
    2) `TODO`

Once you have executed above steps, your GCP instance is ready for [Janssen installation](https://github.com/ossdhaval/home/blob/main/development.md#install-janssen).

## Install Janssen

Janssen installation involves running two commands. During installation, setup will prompt few questions and you'll also need to accept license. During this process, among other inputs, the setup will also ask you to name your Janssen server. You can name it anyting but make note of it, as we will need that name in future. For now, we will assume that server is named *demoexample.jans.io*.

First command to run is as below. It'll download required installation script.

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanssenProject/jans-setup/master/install.py`

Once you have the script, you can start installation. You can either start installation with or without test data loading along with it. Test data load will help you to run unit tests when you are writing code. You can also choose to load it later when needed.

To install with test data load:

`sudo python3 install.py â€“args="-t"`

To install without test data load:

`sudo python3 install.py`

Load test data separately from installation process: 

```
cd /opt/jans/jans-setup/
sudo python3 setup.py -t -x -n
```


After successful execution, you have a working Janssen setup. 

Now, to access Janssen end-points, please map `IP` address of your Janssen server with name of Janssen server which you provided during install process. This mapping needs to be in `/etc/hosts` file of host from where you intend to access the end-point URLs. Once this mapping is done, you can access below mentioned end-points to verify your Janssen installation:


    |Service           | Example endpoint                                                       |   
    |------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    |Auth server       | `https://demoexample.jans.io/.well-known/openid-configuration`         |
    |fido2             | `https://demoexample.jans.io/.well-known/fido2-configuration`          |
    |scim              | `https://demoexample.jans.io/.well-known/scim-configuration`           |   
    

## Setup your workspace

Setting up your workspace is as easy as cloning Janssen module repository from Github. You can clone the repository of the module that you intend to work on.

Here, we are going ahead with Janssen auth server module.

#### Clone Jans Auth

`git clone https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans-auth-server`

`cd jans-auth-server`

At this point, you should be able to successfully compile the module using `mvn compile`

In order to be able to run tests, your code in your local workspace should be able to connect to Janssen server that you installed previously. This is done by creating a profile and few more commands. That is what we will do next.

### 3. Create test profile 

#### What is a profile:
At the most basic level, a profile is a directory, with the same name as your server and contains files that enable your code to connect with Janssen server. In following steps, We will create profile directory where your code is and put required files under it. During it's installation, the Janssen server has already created these files for us to copy.

1) Get profile name which we will be using. Run this command where Janssen server is installated.

`cat /opt/jans/jans-setup/output/test/jans-auth/client/config-oxauth-test-data.properties | grep clientKeyStoreFile | cut -d "/" -f2 | cut -d "/" -f1`

 Output of this command is the profile name that you need to use in following steps. Generally, this name is same as name of your Janssen server.

2) Create and setup your profile
 - Setup profile for *client* module of *jans-auth-server*
   - `mkdir ./client/profiles/<profile_name>/`
   - `cp -rf /opt/jans/jans-setup/output/test/jans-auth/client/* ./client/profiles/<profile_name>/`
   - `cp ./client/profiles/default/client_keystore.jks ./client/profiles/<profile_name>/`
 - Setup profile for *server* module of *jans-auth-server*
   - `mkdir ./server/profiles/<profile_name>/`
   - `cp -rf /opt/jans/jans-setup/output/test/jans-auth/server/* ./server/profiles/<profile_name>/`
   - `cp ./server/profiles/default/client_keystore.jks ./server/profiles/<profile_name>/`



### 4) Setup remote workspace

`NOTE:` These steps are only needed if we need to run build and tests on a different machine then the one where you have installed Janssen server. Also its not needed if we deploy CA cert into Janssen instalation.

#### 4.1 Import self signed http cert into java truststore.

Copy `/etc/certs/httpd.crt` from CE server to `<path>/httpd.crt` or run:

`openssl s_client -connect <ce-server>:443 2>&1 |sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > /tmp/httpd.crt`

`/opt/jre/bin/keytool -import -alias jans_http -keystore /opt/jre/lib/security/cacerts -file /tmp/httpd.crt`


#### 4.2 Fill the right configuration `cibaEndUserNotificationConfig`. It's in `jansConfDyn` in ou=jans-auth,ou=configuration,o=jans. After restart Jans Auth server:

```
systemctl restart jans-auth
```

### 5. Run build:

```
mvn -fae -Dcfg=<profile_name> -Dcvss-score=9 -Dfindbugs.skip=true -Ddependency.check=false clean compile package
```

You should be able to run test cases successfully.

### 6. Useful commands

- `systemctl status jans-auth.service`: To know status of Janssen auth server service
- `systemctl restart jans-auth`: Restart Janssen auth service
- `systemctl list-units --all jans*`: To know status of all Janssen services

- Attendees:
	- ossdhaval
  - nynymike
  - yuriyz
  - yurem
  - moabu
  - hemantkmehta
  
#### Agenda
- Since this is initial triage meeting we quickly refreshed our understanding of three labels: `needs-triage`, `ready-for-triage`, `triaged`
- Went through current open issues
	- priority-0, priority-1
	- needs-discussion
	- ready-for-triage (couldn't complete triage for all issues)
- we also discussed about having a label for issues which we don't want to take up immediately, but then we decided not to have additional label but let priority label decide when we take up issue in active development
- [dhaval] Code owners are requested to watch for issues labelled with their component label and `ready-for-triage`
- [Mike] Janssen should target weekly release cycle
- [Mike] Janssen releases automation and release notes creation needs to improve. Similar to [mod_auth_openidc](https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/releases/tag/v2.4.10)
- [Moabu] Discussed monorepo
- [Mike] will discuss issues to get more clarity on business demand and priority.

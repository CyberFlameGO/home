- Attendees:
	- ossdhaval
  - nynymike
  - yuriyz
  - yurem
  - moabu
  - hemantkmehta
  
#### Agenda
- Since this is initial triage meeting we quickly refreshed our understanding of three labels: `needs-triage`, `ready-for-triage`, `triaged`
- Go through current open issues
	- priority-0, priority-1
	- needs-discussion
	- ready-for-triage (need to find good first issue, help wanted)
- we also discussed about having a label for issues which we don't want to take up immediately, but then we decided not to have additional label but let priority label decide when we take up issue in active development
- Messaging
	- Code owners are requested to watch for issues labelled with their component label and `ready-for-triage`


- Action items:
	- Automation for `needs-triage` label (Dhaval/Mohammad)
	- Add PRs to triage
	- Use github project boards
	- automation to add comment on issue when a label is added
	- monorepo as issue should be 
	- Janssen releases automation

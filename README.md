# Goal

The goal of Janssen is to build the world's fastest cloud native identity and access management platform.

Why not just use a hosted identity platform like Okta or Auth0? Well, if you can, you should. But there are a few reasons why you may not want to:
1. Your service has a large number of users or devices
2. The privacy or security profile of a hosted solution is not acceptable
3. You need the freedom to customize and you can't get it done otherwise
4. You need to embed this security component in your solution  

So for all of you who can't move to a hosted identity platform, keep reading!

# Why the name Janssen?

The Janssen brothers of ArenDonk, Belgium bred the world's fastest family of racing pigeons. Complex open source infrastructure, like breeding, requires incremental improvement. Janssen racing pigeons revolutionized the sport. The Janssen Project seeks to revolutionize access management.
